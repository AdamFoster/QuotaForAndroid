Quota for Android (See http://www.southfreo.com/QuotaforAndroid/Home.html) 


## Overview

Quota allows you to monitor your Mobile Phone & ISP usage, News sites, Account Balances (Toll and Bank), FF and Loyalty cards. 

Quota is powered by [QuotaXML](http://www.southfreo.com/iiquota/QuotaXML.html)  which is a dynamic open XML standard which describes how to extract the information from websites.

## Want to contribute?

GitHub has some great articles on [how to get started with Git and GitHub](http://help.github.com/) and how to [fork a project](http://help.github.com/forking/).

Contributers are recommended to fork the app on GitHub (but don't have too). Create a feature branch, push the branch to git hub, press Pull Request and write a simple explanation.

One fix per commit. If say a a commit closes the open issue 12. Just add `closes #12` in your commit message to close that issue automagically.
